# HackRU Spring 2023
### This project was developed by:
#### Amber Safeer '26, Ivan Zheng '26, Jason Ordonez '26, and Pablo Tirado '26
as part of the "NJ Transit Hack" for Rutgers University. Created in only 48 hours, our project works as a data manipulation tool to rewrite arrival and departure times of trains based on the number of passengers boarding and disembarking the vehicle.
